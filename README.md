# JavaScriptUIKata
A code Kata developed for the UI developer course level 1

This code contains 2 html pages, one is index.html which accesses the printer, and the other is just a practice page from udemy.

For the printer, entering text into the text box and selectiong the color will display the text below in the selected color, with the ink levels and paper level changing accordingly.

You are able to add paper and change the ink cartridge as well if you run out.
